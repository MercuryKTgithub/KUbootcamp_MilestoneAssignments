##### Discription of the Challenge: 
##### This project is about using mainly jQuery, moment.js and strictly Bootstrap-oriented layout to develop a snapshot of a Daytime Task Scheduler where its scope concerns on a particular day of the year that was feature on the interface where a worker or end-user will be looking at to add or edit his or her task(s). 


###### Beside editing capability, the scheduler should be able identify what task(s) has been pass-due, within the current hour or still waiting to be completed by implementing different Bootstrap color usages such as gray, red, or green respectively. There is a save button for every task that was entered or edited. The mock-up and the animation of the project requirement suggests that upon clicking those Save buttons, the content of such tasks should be saved and reflected back after hitting a browser refresh button. An ad-hoc routine was added to void duplicate-save that could cause duplicate task records in the local Storage.

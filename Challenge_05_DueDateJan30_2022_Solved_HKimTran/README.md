##### Discription of the Challenge: 
##### This project is about using mainly jQuery, moment.js and strictly Bootstrap-oriented layout to develop a snapshot of a Daytime Task Scheduler where its scope concerns on a particular day of the year rendered at the center of a web page interface where a worker or an end-user will be looking at to add or edit his or her task(s) for that day at work.


###### Beside editing capability, the scheduler is deemed to identify what task(s) has been pass-due, within the current hour or still waiting to be completed through the usage of different Bootstrap color such as gray, red, or green respectively. There is a Save button for every task that was entered or edited. The mock-up and the animation of the project requirement suggests that upon clicking those Save buttons, the content of such tasks shall be saved and reflected back after as a result of clickin on the browser's refresh button. An ad-hoc routine was added to void duplicate-save that could cause duplicate task records in the local-storage of the browser.

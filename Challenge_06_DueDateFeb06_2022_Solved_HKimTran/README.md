##### Discription of the Challenge: 
##### Utilizing 3rd-party APIs to retrieve desirable data through JavaScript's/jQuery/CSS/HTML tech stack is the objective of this project. In particular this project expects the developer to use the _OpenWeather One Call API_ (https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) to obtain weather data for a city's weather-search in the app called **Weather Dashboard**. The app should be able to display the city's weather data that entails common metrics such as temperature, humidity, wind-speed, and UV indexes for the city's current and next 5 day forecasting. The project also expects developer to use some sort of browser storage mechanism, namely _localStorage_, to facilitate the app's ability to display this city-search history and everything should appear in one single web-page layout per project-mock up that looks like the following screenshot(s)

##### Discription of the Challenge: 
###### This project is about developing a password generator through the means of clicking a button by developing more javascript from the existing scripts.js provided in the dev folder. The project expects a series of interactions with the web end-user to obtain the criteria for a desirable password concerning variety of character types (lowercase, uppercase, numeric, symbols) to be included and the password length requirement so as to make the password more secured. Programatically javascript promps are expected together with other javascript implementations of functions|event-listener|array|classes|varialbes|etc which are the topics discussed in Module 3 so that such desired password can be generated and printed on the screen per given mock-up (reflected style.css and index.html)
